XUI
===

A lightweight, dead simple, microtiny, super modular JavaScript framework for building mobile web applications.


### XUI Application Authors and Hackers

Its true: the minified code is _super tiny_. You can find more information, downloads and documentation at http://xuijs.com (be warned: out of date!) ---if you want to build your own custom XUI or help contribute: please read on! The best documentation is in the source and the tests.

### XUI Contributors and Hackers

To get the full source you need to use Git. _git clone_ the repo (as per usual) and then pull in the dependencies via _git submodule init_ and _git submodule update_. To build xui, run _build_. There are other tasks for code minification or building particular versions of XUI, for specific platforms:
    _build profile=bb_ - Builds a version of XUI for BlackBerries (uses Sizzle as the selector engine).
    _build profile=ie_ - Builds a version of XUI for Internet Explorer
